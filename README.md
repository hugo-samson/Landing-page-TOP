# Landing-page-TOP
In this repository, I'm going to create my first landing page.

This project is the final completion of TheOdinProject's CSS and Flexbox module.

At this stage, and in this project, I'm able to arrange the different elements and blocks that make up a web page as I see fit.

At the end of this project, I've mastered the basics of HTML, CSS and Flexbox.
